I created my portfolio that introduces who I am, my work, and how to contact me.

The goal was to create a website that has responsive design to ensures that the web application will render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.

I used Bootstrap to develop my portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images
